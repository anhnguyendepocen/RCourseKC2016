  "body": "# Course Description\r\nThis one-day course is for fisheries professionals and students interested in expanding their R skills to include analysis of age and growth data.  Through a sequence of demonstrations and hands-on application exercises, participants will use R to construct and apply an age-length key to estimate ages of individual fish from their lengths, summarize mean length-at-age with a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), statistically compare VBGF parameters between two or more groups of fish, and construct appropriate metrics and graphics for comparing precision (APE, ACV) and bias (age agreement table, tests of symmetry, and age-bias plots) between two sets of estimated ages.  Participants should be familiar with the fundamentals of R, including basic applications.\r\n\r\n# Pre-Course Preparation\r\n* Install the latest version of R (v3.3.1) on your laptop.  [Directions for a first install are here]().  If you are using Windows and already have R installed, then [an easy method to upgrade is described here](http://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/\").\r\n* I prefer to use RStudio to interact with R (but RStudio is not required for this course).  [Directions to install and prepare RStudio are here]() (along with a quick introduction to the RStudio interface).\r\n* Install the FSA, FSAdata, nlstools, dplyr, and XXX packages for use in the course.  Directions for installing packages are [here if you plan to use RStudio]() and, if you plan to use R directly, [here for Windows]() and [here for MacOS]().\r\n* The materials for this workshop are based on my *Introduction to Fisheries Analysis with R* book (IFAR).  This book is NOT required for the workshop.  However, I have secured a 20% discount for the book for participants in this workshop.  [Contact me](mailto:dogle@northland.edu) if you would like details about how to receive this discount.\r\n* You may want to (re)familiarize yourself with R basics (IFAR Chapters 1-3), age-length keys (IFAR Chapter ), von Bertalanffy growth functions (IFAR Chapter ), and age estimation comparisons (IFAR Chapter ).\r\n* Finally, download all R Handouts, R scripts, and Slides for the course (available in this ZIP archive).  I **highly recommend** printing all R Handouts for taking notes on during the workshop (and for reference after the workshop).\r\n\r\n# Course Materials\r\n1. **Age-Length Key -- Construction**\r\n    * [Slides](https://github.com/droglenc/RCourseKC2016/raw/master/Slides/AgeLengthKey.pptx) // [Handout](https://github.com/droglenc/RCourseKC2016/raw/master/ALK_Construction.pdf) // [Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/RCourseKC2016/master/Scripts/ALK_Construction.R) // [Exercise](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/exercises/LORockBass_ALK_A.html)\r\n\r\n2. **Age-Length Key -- Application**\r\n    * [Handout]() // [Script]() // [Exercise](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/exercises/LORockBass_ALK_B.html)\r\n\r\n3. **Growth -- Fit von Bertalanffy Growth Function**\r\n    * [Slides]() // [Handout]() // [Script]() // [Exercise]()\r\n\r\n4. **Growth -- Compare von Bertalanffy Growth Functions**\r\n    * [Slides]() // [Handout]() // [Script]() // [Exercise]()\r\n\r\n5. **Age Comparisons -- Precision and Bias**\r\n     * [Slides]() // [Handout]() // [Script]() // [Exercise]()\r\n\r\n# Follow-Up\r\n* Please complete [this survey regarding this short course]().\r\n* If you have any questions please feel free [to contact me](mailto:dogle@northland.edu)\r\n",
